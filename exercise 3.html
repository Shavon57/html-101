<p>This exercise is about making lists <br>
    Here's what I like about lists:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
     </ul>

     <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
     <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
